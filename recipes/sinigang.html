        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Sinigang is a Filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour and savory taste.
             It is most often associated with tamarind, although it can use other sour fruits
              and leaves as the souring agent. It is one of the more popular dishes in Filipino 
              cuisine. The soup is usually accompanied by rice. </p>
